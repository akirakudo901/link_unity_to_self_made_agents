1) Check why the cumulative rewards is behaving weirdly when we load progress.
2) Check if using the same sources for training both the qnet and policy makes it more learning.
3) Try to implement and see if an open source code would work on our code - see if it might be my 
SAC code, or my trainer's code's problem that shit aren't learned.
